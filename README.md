# 1 on 1 Automation

Do you have [1:1s](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/how-to-start-one-on-ones-your-teams/) with a team member? Do you forget to open the issue until the last minute? Do you want to share a "journal of your thoughts" during the course of your week with your manager or a peer? If any of that sounds familiar, this issue could be right for you!

This repo contains a sample set of issue templates and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows that are the basis of a lot of automation I use in my [work at GitHub](https://matthewjmccullough.com/about/). I hope seeing the concrete examples helps inspire you to set up some of the same with your team members or peers.
